Well, I can say myself is quite **Figmaniac** (people who use Figma to get shit done on anything 🥴) haha kinda annoying too for some people. I've been using Figma almost a year since I'm stepping into this User Interface Design games. My first impression using this tool is kinda "hmmm strange, I don't think I'm going to like it." because it's strange to design in web browser. All I imagine designing with it was like Canva things haha. Totally strange.

But that was only last for few days and I'm never feel so wrong before this. **YES**. after a week using it everything was clicking. Somethings that made me feel working become easier is their collaboration system. Figma truly in their straight way to be the best Collaboration Tool. Very glad my environment told me to use this tool way back then.

After using it for few month and feel so helped with this tool, Figma released their plugins feature. I don't know, this is something top-notch feature from Figma. I've been using _Adobe Xd_ but their plugin is something that I'd rather would not use 💆🏻‍♂️. And until today I always rely on Figma plugin's to finish my task or anything else.

### Personal recommendation.

If you're designer especially focusing in User Interface Design or User Experience, I would like to share my recommendation of Figma Plugin that helped to speed up my workflow ✌️

> 💡Oh right, in case you don't know this. You can access plugin easily by hitting `"Cmd" + "/"` in Mac, or `"Ctrl" + "/"` in Windows. And then just type their name.

```javascript
class Btn extends React.Component {
   events = {};
   constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.state = {
         id: props.id,
         text: props.children,
      };
   }
   render() {
      return (
         <button type='button' id={this.state.id}>
            {this.state.text}
         </button>
      );
   }
}
```
